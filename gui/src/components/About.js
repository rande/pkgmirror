            This project has been created by{' '}
            <a href="https://thomas.rabaix.net">Thomas Rabaix</a> to avoid
            downtime while working with remote dependencies. <br />
            <br />
            The backend is coded using the Golang programming language for
            syncing the different sources. On the frontend, ReactJS is used with
            Material-UI. <br />
